A Python tool deployed on Streamlit to extract data from uploaded text files, convert each into a downloadable Excel file, and display row-wise averages for numeric data. Install Python 3.x and required libraries (pandas, openpyxl, streamlit), then run streamlit run app.py. Upload text files (e.g., CSV-like), select data fields, and download Excel files via the Streamlit interface. View averages on the app. Example: ID,Value1,Value2\n1,10,20\n2,15,25 becomes an Excel file with averages like Row 1: Value1: 10, Value2: 20. Customize extraction for specific formats; non-numeric columns are excluded
